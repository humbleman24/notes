## TBE-Net: A Three-Branch embedding network with part-aware ability and feature complementary learning for vehicle re-identification

### introduction

contributions:

- three branch network improve the performance of current models
- present the flexible local attention module
- propose a complementary branch

it seems that the complementary branch is important because it provides structural features and multi-granularity features. 

a new sub-region interaction module is introduced to make full use of the relations between the divided sub-regions.

### related work

**global feature**: helpful for grasping the global appearance feature of the vehicle, these models do not have the ability to perceive distinguishable details from local regions of vehicle.

**local region feature**: local regions may constantly change under cross-camera video surveillance, limiting the application of these methods based on pre-defined fixed key feature points and local regions.

**attention-based methods:** not many illustration

**different size pooling:** different granularity features tend to have different information expressing abilities. global average pooling operation can integrate the spatial relationship between feature maps, and the global maximum pooling can gather the salience information of the feature maps.
