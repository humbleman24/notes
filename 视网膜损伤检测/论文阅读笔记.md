### Abstract

pathological problems: 病理问题

OCT has been a transformative breakthrough for developing high-resolution **cross-sectional images.**

*what is cross-sectional images?*

for a proper diagnosis, imperative to delineate the multiple layers

segmentation-based approach to identify seven distinct layers of retina

present the SliceOCTNet, a customized U-shaped Convolutional Neural Network that introduces group normalization and intricate skip connections.

Group Normalization stabilized the model and improved layer identification even working in small datasets.

skip connections also contributed to an improvement in the spatial outlook of the model

*what is spatial outlook of the model?*

implementing a hybrid loss function addresses the class imbalance problem in the dataset

## Automated retinal disease classification using hybrid transformer model (SViT) using optical coherence tomography images

### Abstract

automated eye\retinal disease classification and segmentations using OCT or spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) images.

difficult in classify because of their subtle differences and intricate features

proposes hybrid SqueezeNet-vision transformer model that combines the strengths of SqueezeNet and vision transformer, capturing local and global features of OCT images.

HIGH ACCURACY!

## Boost diagnostic performance in retinal disease classification utilizing deep ensemble classifiers based on OCT
### Abstract

damage to the retinal blood vessels is critical in diabetic retinopathy

简单的解释就是，糖尿病会导致这些血管的结构和功能出现问题，损伤血管壁，进而容易出血或渗漏

past model constraint in learning from diverse data types and structures and being susceptibility to overfitting with large and heterogeneous datasets, resulting in compromised generalization capabilities

propose a hybrid learning model for the classification with improved generalization capabilities. 

constructed upon ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 

empowers the model to excel in discerning intricate image patterns while efficiently extracting hierarchical prediction from various regions within images

*what is hierarchical prediction and why?*

to enhance classification accuracy and mitigate overfitting, we eliminate the fully connected layer from the base model and introduce a concatenate layer to combine two objective learning prediction.

Notably, we address the interpretability issue, providing clear and insightful results, making our model suitable for deployment
